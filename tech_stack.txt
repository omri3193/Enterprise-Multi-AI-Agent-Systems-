SonarQube → Open source → Checking Code Quality

Checks performed by SonarQube

1. Bugs

2. Code Smells (Bad Practices)

func = 300 lines (big fn)

Split into:

func1

func2

func3

Benefits:

Readability

Analyze easily

3. Code Duplication

app.py → func1

main.py → func1

test.py → func1

Dead Code Bug
